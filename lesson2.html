    <div class="question-title">What is a <b>variable</b> in Python?
     </div>
     <div class="answer">

  <div class="question">
    <div class="question-title"> What does it mean to <b>assign</b> a value to a variable?  How do you do it?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
                  Assign a value to a variable  name = expression
                  whatever is on the left side of the equal sign gets the contents on the right side of the equal sign.  
		  For example:  name = 'Udacity' and now that name is declared, if you issue in python print name, the result will be Udacity

  <div class="question">
    <div class="question-title">What's the difference between what the equals <span class="code">sign = means</span> in <span class="code"> 2 + 3 = 5</span> and <span class="code">my_variable = 5 ?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
   <p>

                  The equal sign means an assignment like <span class="code"> my_variables = 5</span>  (5 take the place of <span class="code">my_variable</span>, sine it was declared)

                  Whereas <span class="code">2 + 3 = 5</span> is the mathematical equation
